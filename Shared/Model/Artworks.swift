                        This project was done for the school assignment "Gallery In The Grove", and I worked with a parter. We were not given any specific topics and we chose "racism".

                        Our installation consists of 5 faces of different race stereotypes, essentially different ethnicities. All the panels together form a cube which represents all human beings in the world, it has rectangular edges instead of being a sphere like the earth because our world is not always so perfect. All brush strokes on the same panel have one hue with different variety of values and intensities. Each hue is the base colour of one skin colour. We wanted to create layers because of the complexity and depth of everyone’s culture and background. The eyebrows and eyes are carved out of the faces, but we can tell from their dramatic size and shape difference that the distinct features of each race. Straightforward, unembellished racist comments are written directly on to the canvas, with black sharpie markers. Their contents shouldn’t be the audiences’ focus. However, the sensation of how these bold fonts are ruining the beautiful painting underneath should arise in every individual's viewing experience.

                         

                        There are two stages of this installation. When the light bulb is off, the viewers are able to see the skin colours and the typical unkind words that have been said to a specific group. When the light bulb is on, the outer appearance of these faces are dimmed by the light coming out from within, so are the comments that contain racism. Our artwork takes on the responsibility to stand up against racism, the main message is that our souls are all the same and equal. It also serves as a reminder to those who have been discriminated against before due to their races: as long as you have a light in your heart, it is bright enough to shine through the words that might have hurt you. What others think cannot drag you down or define who you are. We all have the strength to fight against those who don’t deserve you.

Those are the most extreme facial expression that I have. I personally become very calm when I'm really mad and doesn't show any emotions through my facial expression and that is the reason why the one that describes anger seems like resting face. I chose the colours based on the emotions that would match well with specific colour.

                        I chose only acrylic paint for this artwork as well since there was only the paint in my home and I couldn't find oil paint with a reasonable cost and amount. The paint is called Turner Acryl Gounache and it's from Turner Colour Works LTD. And I specifically used white, black, cobalt blue, and sky blue from the package.

                        For showing how my muscles or wrinkles are located and how those parts have undulation when I make a facial expression of confused, I used different colours. They are actually all based on blue but I used darker blue colours for parts shade and lighter blue colours for parts near the surface where the light reflects the most. When different colours come aside each other, I blended them. It was difficult doing this with acrylic paint since it got dried so quickly, so I also tried to work on blending as quick as I can.

                        Since the artwork is showing a facial expression of CONFUSED and I thought wrinkles that would come up around eyebrows are a big key for people to see the person's emotion, so I emphasized wrinkles and shade around my eyebrow by using both dark and light colours.

                        This artwork is used movement from the principles of art because the different blue colours describes my muscles pulled up and  compressed from the expression and it's a movement of the muscles. Also, gazing from the postmodern principles is used because the eye is looking straight at viewers.

                        As I mentioned, the theme of this artwork is CONFUSED, so I chose blue for the base colour of this emotion.  I wanted to use a dark colour that gives viewers a little sense of negative and a word of "blue" is also used for describing a state of gloom or depression, so blue matches the best.

                        There are a few points to improve, such as too white on the eyebrow and needed more wrinkles to paint. However, I feel it was successfully painted since the highlighted part on my eyelid and the reflected light in my eyeball are well described and the volume, amount, and thickness of my eyelash is painted perfectly. And also, it was a great chance to learn the characteristics of acrylic paint since I could experience the difficulty of blending colours.

                        I used only acrylic paint for this artwork because it was only what I had at home for painting and couldn't find oil paint with a reasonable price and amount. I specifically used white, black, burnt sienna, and perm lemon.

                        Since the paint gets dried very quickly and it was too thick for blending colours, I expressed contrast of shade and high parts around my eye by using multiple colours separately (without blending). The colours are based on a same colour as the base colour which is the light yellow and I made into a various thick or light colours by adding black, brown or white. For the parts located deeper from the surface of my face, I used darker colours based on the light yellow (base colour), brown, and black. And for the parts located higher from the surface, I used lighter colours based on the light yellow (base colour), brown, and white. For creating even more colours with different thickness, I changed the ratio of those simple colours and layered on. I started painting with the lightest colour, layered on darker colours, and finally painted my eyebrow, eyelash, some lines around or on my eyelid with the darkest colour.

                        This artwork is showing an emotion of HAPPY and a facial expression of smiling. The eye I painted is actually me taken a photo thinking about something funny and smiling. With  some different colours, shapes, and lines, I described how the muscles around my eye lifted up or moved and how it is reflected the light.

                        It is used movement and unity from the principles of art because the muscles have natural lines for the facial expression as a movement and different colours are united to form an eye. And gazing from the postmodern principles is used because the eye behind a narrowed eyelid and the eyelash is looking at viewers.

                        Because the them of this artwork is HAPPY, I chose yellow as the base colour to express this emotion. I think this colour has a positive sense because it stands out well from darker colours and I see a lot of time that lights and sun are coloured in yellow when people's pictures or design.

                        When I look at the artwork carefully, there are some points to improve, such as rough eyelash and too dark eyebrow and lines of an eyelid. However, I feel my attempts, process, and the artwork were successful because I believe I could catch the characteristics of acrylic paint and use it well and could describe muscles or other parts of around my eye with different colours.

                        I chose just acrylic paint for this artwork because it was difficult to get oil paint for me at that time. I specifically used white, black, and sky blue.

                        For this artwork, I used simple colours because there would be not many wrinkles or complex features when a person makes this facial expression. So I wanted only shades and top parts to be shown for describing how muscles and other parts get relax with no movement such as being pulled up or compressed. Also, I paid an attention for the eyeball part for for the eye to express BORED better. Since I wanted the eye to be looked like being in a daze, I painted the reflected view bigger in the black eye. By doing this, the eye is looked more zoned out and it gives viewers the emotion clear and strongly. And adding to those techniques, I also focused on the detail too. Because my skin has some freckles and obvious pores between my eyes and nose, so I painted them after painting everything.

                        To convey this artwork is showing a facial expression of BORED, shape of the parts around my eye, selection and combination of colours, and some details were the keys.

                        In this artwork, emphasis and unity from the principles of art are used. Because the light blue parts which is top parts that reflects the light well such as my cheek bone or other tissue stands out since it's painted with a light blue. And unity because thin and small hears gather in a shape to form eyebrow or eyelash. Also, gazing from the postmodern principles is used since the eye is looking at viewers.

                        As the theme was BORED, my idea was to create a facial expression looked like inactive and tired, and I felt it should be tended to be negative mood but not too negative. So that's why I chose blue but also light blue in some parts and the whole artwork doesn't look completely negative.

                        As a point to improve, I could use more colours to show more detail of the muscles or wrinkles around the eye. However, I'm feeling that this was done successfully since I personally like this colouring and how the reflected lights are painted. And it shows the expression well with the simple shapes and colours even though I didn't blend colours, so it doesn't look natural but realistic to the emotion.

                        I chose paper clay and acrylic paint for the media of this project. I could use an actual clay made with soil but I didn't have kiln to bake, so paper clay was the best material I could find for creating this artwork at home. Paper clay gets dried so quickly, it turns to be very hard, and easy to get because the price is normally cheap. But instead, it is easy to break if you make it thinner or with some cracks on.

                        I have a lot of experience using paper clay to create artworks when I was a kid but I hadn't touched clay for long since then, so I enjoyed creating this. But compared to my childhood, I struggled in some parts of the process because I was trying to make it more precisely and detailed in much smaller scale. First one was from quality of the clay that I used and its feature which is becoming hard quick, I had to think about a tip not to let the clay gets dried. So I used some water to keep the clay soft and make it smooth with no cracks. I prepared a cup of water and put some water on my hands and the pieces that I was working on every minute. Also, I kept a clay that I wasn't using in a plastic bag with a zipper for make sure it doesn't touch an air. Second one was that smaller or thinner pieces were easy to break. If the piece is larger and used a lot of clay, it would be hard like actual pottery but smaller pieces are fragile and light since it's made with paper. So I had to be really careful when I paint on the pieces. For example, Chinese chives on the main dish and grass noodles on a side dish were thin, so some of them were actually broken while painting. To fix this problem, I mixed a little bit of water with the paint. Because acrylic paint is thick, I wanted it to be lighter that I don't have to push hard when I paint on. The third one was that it was difficult to make the surface smooth. Because it's easy to get cracked and the clay is rough, I had to think carefully about how much water I should use, how much I can press without breaking it, and how much clay I should use for each piece. So while creating this artwork, I also focused on the temperature, humidity, and condition of the clay. And the fourth one is that there were always some spots that I couldn't complete painting because of the rough surface. Some of the pieces have holes or lines, so I used thinner paintbrush for make sure I paint the entire surface. In the process of creating this, I encountered some troubles or difficulties but I came through with these useful or helpful ideas.

                        I believe this artwork was successfully done. It took about a week in total and I hadn't done using clay for long, so I could be always excited when I was going step by step. And there were actually some steps that I had never done, such as using some water and make clay soft and smooth, painting dried clay with acrylic paint, and creating something realistically. So it gave me a chance to be more creative and learn some techniques of using clay.

                        I created one of my favourite meal with paper clay. This meal is a set meal in Japanese style and called teishoku. I often eat it when I go for a ski trip to Nagano (located in southern part of Japan) because the restaurant is located at bottom of the mountain. The staffs there are so warm and the meal gives me some energy, so I love it and its atmosphere.

To convey the message by communicating with viewers through a sculpture, I chose its location to be in a park because park is where a various people come for different purposes. For examples, kids come for the playground and play with other kids, students come for chill or talk with friends, parents come for watching their kids and expand their community by being friends with other parents, and elder people come for exercise and seeing changing seasons in the nature such as trees and flowers. As I've actually seen these people using the park, I wanted a lot of people to see or use this sculpture and feel warm or have a peaceful mind. So finally, I chose the first sketch to create since the sculpture is the most eligible for my message. The first sculpture has two benches that people can sit and it makes more chance for people to interact with others if one sits on one and other sits on another one. Also, the design that two hands are holding the benches will make the situation better.

                        I didn't put on the maquette but the actual sculpture will have two light on each side of the circle shaped parts and it will allow people to use it even though it's dark. And it will also have a role of a street light in the area.

                        I chose using multiple different media because I thought it will help describing each images better and give some impact to viewers. At first, I was going to only use acrylic paint because I've used one for many times during this course. But I  also wanted to try using materials that I normally don't use or had never used before, so I finally decided to use 8 different of them in 9 different styles which are acrylic paint, coloured pencils, pencils, water colour, origami (coloured paper), pastel, juxtaposition+collage, and crayons.

                        Through creating this artwork, I used some techniques that I knew and newly learned. For Window View From Airplane, painting clouds was a new skill that I learned. I used dried paintbrush and started with the lightest colour which is white for its shapes and added darker colours which are a few gray colours for the shades. And last, I added white again for each cloud's highlight points. For Kilauea Volcano, I painted in mosaic form because I had never created an art in this style and I thought it would be an excited challenging for me. I used a lot of different colours but in a small changing to try making the picture looks as smooth as it could be for viewers to know what the picture is showing. For End Of The Summer, I was confident with using colour pencils, so I tried to make it looks more realistic by using gradation for each pieces of plants or moss to show the darker and lighter parts. For Snowy Woods, I recalled the techniques I learned when I created my portrait last year and used the thin erasers and blending with tissue paper. For Fuji Mountain, I blended light orange,  yellow, and blue to show sky in the early morning and painted the reflected mountain with its edge being jiggly because it's on the surface of a lake. For Madarao, I tried not to miss any small parts or details because I knew it wouldn't look realistic if I cut them. By using scissors and a cutter, I cut out every single shades of the clouds and woods or path on the mountain. Like painting clouds with acrylic paint, I first glued lighter coloured pieces and put darker ones on top. For Katchewanooka Lake, I shove pastel and blended with my fingers. Because it's difficult to create a colour since it's not like painting, I used a various colours to show the gradation in the sky and on the surface of the lake. For Bay At Izu, I used cardboard, bubble wrap, supermarket flyer, toothpick, and a string to emphasize each parts. For example, the ocean is made with bubble wrap and a blue paper under it so express water, an orange is for sun to show it's freshness and energy, some chocolates are for houses to show their solidness, and tooth picks are for fences and a utility pole. For Cicada, I also focused on how the light is on the object and the floor covered with stones. The light is from right to left, so I put darker colours to show shades in left side of each pieces of stones and a cicada.

                        This artwork is for viewers to realize the beauty of nature and the power that nature has. But at the same time, it's also for myself having some time reviewing memorable and beautiful moments from this year, so there're these two meanings in it and I believe its mood is relax, calmed, and sentimental.

                        "Nature" is formed with these different elements or atmosphere and they create a good balance in the "nature". For creating the 9 different moments, I used informal balance, formal balance, rhythm, proportion, repetition, movement, and unity from the principles of art. And I used juxtaposition, recontextualization, and layering from the postmodern principles.

                        Overall, I'm believing that my attempts were successful because I could go over 9 different styles of art. Some of them made me review and improve what I learned in the Grade 12 art course and some of them gave me some chance and time to explore my art skills and know how much I can do and how much I'm still green. At the same time, I could know what kind of art styles I love or I'm good at to express something.

                        For my culminating assignment, I created an artwork themed nature. I chose this theme because when I was thinking back on my memories this year, many of the beautiful views of nature either in Lakefield and here in Japan came up and I realized those views or atmosphere made me relax or feel better in my mind a lot during this difficult time. And I also wanted the viewers to know that the natural power that nature has, such as woods, mountains, lakes, and so on can heal people’s minds and reduce their concerns.

                        Also, through this artwork, I wanted to express the beauty of nature. Since I love the outdoor, I had seen many different faces of it and each has its own fascination. For example, in summer, trees are green and everything sounds active. But in winter, the air sounds sharp but quiet from the cold weather and snow. To show the different seasons, time, and places, I chose 9 of my favourite moments and described in different materials, and elements.

                        I chose using multiple different media because I thought it will help describing each images better and give some impact to viewers. At first, I was going to only use acrylic paint because I've used one for many times during this course. But I  also wanted to try using materials that I normally don't use or had never used before, so I finally decided to use 8 different of them in 9 different styles which are acrylic paint, coloured pencils, pencils, water colour, origami (coloured paper), pastel, juxtaposition+collage, and crayons.

                        Through creating this artwork, I used some techniques that I knew and newly learned. For Window View From Airplane, painting clouds was a new skill that I learned. I used dried paintbrush and started with the lightest colour which is white for its shapes and added darker colours which are a few gray colours for the shades. And last, I added white again for each cloud's highlight points. For Kilauea Volcano, I painted in mosaic form because I had never created an art in this style and I thought it would be an excited challenging for me. I used a lot of different colours but in a small changing to try making the picture looks as smooth as it could be for viewers to know what the picture is showing. For End Of The Summer, I was confident with using colour pencils, so I tried to make it looks more realistic by using gradation for each pieces of plants or moss to show the darker and lighter parts. For Snowy Woods, I recalled the techniques I learned when I created my portrait last year and used the thin erasers and blending with tissue paper. For Fuji Mountain, I blended light orange,  yellow, and blue to show sky in the early morning and painted the reflected mountain with its edge being jiggly because it's on the surface of a lake. For Madarao, I tried not to miss any small parts or details because I knew it wouldn't look realistic if I cut them. By using scissors and a cutter, I cut out every single shades of the clouds and woods or path on the mountain. Like painting clouds with acrylic paint, I first glued lighter coloured pieces and put darker ones on top. For Katchewanooka Lake, I shove pastel and blended with my fingers. Because it's difficult to create a colour since it's not like painting, I used a various colours to show the gradation in the sky and on the surface of the lake. For Bay At Izu, I used cardboard, bubble wrap, supermarket flyer, toothpick, and a string to emphasize each parts. For example, the ocean is made with bubble wrap and a blue paper under it so express water, an orange is for sun to show it's freshness and energy, some chocolates are for houses to show their solidness, and tooth picks are for fences and a utility pole. For Cicada, I also focused on how the light is on the object and the floor covered with stones. The light is from right to left, so I put darker colours to show shades in left side of each pieces of stones and a cicada.

                        This artwork is for viewers to realize the beauty of nature and the power that nature has. But at the same time, it's also for myself having some time reviewing memorable and beautiful moments from this year, so there're these two meanings in it and I believe its mood is relax, calmed, and sentimental.

                        "Nature" is formed with these different elements or atmosphere and they create a good balance in the "nature". For creating the 9 different moments, I used informal balance, formal balance, rhythm, proportion, repetition, movement, and unity from the principles of art. And I used juxtaposition, recontextualization, and layering from the postmodern principles.

                        Overall, I'm believing that my attempts were successful because I could go over 9 different styles of art. Some of them made me review and improve what I learned in the Grade 12 art course and some of them gave me some chance and time to explore my art skills and know how much I can do and how much I'm still green. At the same time, I could know what kind of art styles I love or I'm good at to express something. And by looking at my art and having a feeling of fulfillment, I could reaffirmed that the love and passion I have in my mind against art is pretty huge.

                        Through creating this artwork, I used some techniques that I knew and newly learned. For Window View From Airplane, painting clouds was a new skill that I learned. I used dried paintbrush and started with the lightest colour which is white for its shapes and added darker colours which are a few gray colours for the shades. And last, I added white again for each cloud's highlight points. For Kilauea Volcano, I painted in mosaic form because I had never created an art in this style and I thought it would be an excited challenging for me. I used a lot of different colours but in a small changing to try making the picture looks as smooth as it could be for viewers to know what the picture is showing. For End Of The Summer, I was confident with using colour pencils, so I tried to make it looks more realistic by using gradation for each pieces of plants or moss to show the darker and lighter parts. For Snowy Woods, I recalled the techniques I learned when I created my portrait last year and used the thin erasers and blending with tissue paper. For Fuji Mountain, I blended light orange,  yellow, and blue to show sky in the early morning and painted the reflected mountain with its edge being jiggly because it's on the surface of a lake. For Madarao, I tried not to miss any small parts or details because I knew it wouldn't look realistic if I cut them. By using scissors and a cutter, I cut out every single shades of the clouds and woods or path on the mountain. Like painting clouds with acrylic paint, I first glued lighter coloured pieces and put darker ones on top. For Katchewanooka Lake, I shove pastel and blended with my fingers. Because it's difficult to create a colour since it's not like painting, I used a various colours to show the gradation in the sky and on the surface of the lake. For Bay At Izu, I used cardboard, bubble wrap, supermarket flyer, toothpick, and a string to emphasize each parts. For example, the ocean is made with bubble wrap and a blue paper under it so express water, an orange is for sun to show it's freshness and energy, some chocolates are for houses to show their solidness, and tooth picks are for fences and a utility pole. For Cicada, I also focused on how the light is on the object and the floor covered with stones. The light is from right to left, so I put darker colours to show shades in left side of each pieces of stones and a cicada.

                        This artwork is for viewers to realize the beauty of nature and the power that nature has. But at the same time, it's also for myself having some time reviewing memorable and beautiful moments from this year, so there're these two meanings in it and I believe its mood is relax, calmed, and sentimental.

                        "Nature" is formed with these different elements or atmosphere and they create a good balance in the "nature". For creating the 9 different moments, I used informal balance, formal balance, rhythm, proportion, repetition, movement, and unity from the principles of art. And I used juxtaposition, recontextualization, and layering from the postmodern principles.

                        Overall, I'm believing that my attempts were successful because I could go over 9 different styles of art. Some of them made me review and improve what I learned in the Grade 12 art course and some of them gave me some chance and time to explore my art skills and know how much I can do and how much I'm still green. At the same time, I could know what kind of art styles I love or I'm good at to express something. And by looking at my art and having a feeling of fulfillment, I could reaffirmed that the love and passion I have in my mind against art is pretty huge. It was a great project to challenge myself and know more about myself.

                        For my culminating assignment, I created an artwork themed nature. I chose this theme because when I was thinking back on my memories this year, many of the beautiful views of nature either in Lakefield and here in Japan came up and I realized those views or atmosphere made me relax or feel better in my mind a lot during this difficult time. And I also wanted the viewers to know that the natural power that nature has, such as woods, mountains, lakes, and so on can heal people’s minds and reduce their concerns.

                        Also, through this artwork, I wanted to express the beauty of nature. Since I love the outdoor, I had seen many different faces of it and each has its own fascination. For example, in summer, trees are green and everything sounds active. But in winter, the air sounds sharp but quiet from the cold weather and snow. To show the different seasons, time, and places, I chose 9 of my favourite moments and described in different materials, and elements.

                            The top left painting represents shock and fear with a monochromatic colour scheme. The emotion is exaggerated with different shades of red. The bottom left painting expresses a sense of sadness with dark green, and the last one explores hesitation, anxiety and struggle. The purple colour makes it more mysterious.

                            The paintings are made on wood panels with a base of acrylic paint and oil paint on top to enhance details. The nature of oil paint makes it easy to blend therefore making the painting smooth while high in contrast.

                        This artwork is made up of two separate pieces, inspired by my hometown, Shanghai. I used a photo I took at The Bund as the background and my headshot as the representative of my identity.

                        For the piece on the right, first, I tried to print my headshot on a transparent paper and layer it on top of the photo, but they didn't blend in well. So I used software to combine these two and the result is satisfactory. I used all real photos in this piece because I want to reflect the reality of life. All the neon lights on the buildings make people feel energized, on the edge of over-whelming.

                        For the one on the left, I used collage to replace the photo which adds a more abstract feeling to it, making it an idealized world. I chose different shades of blue and a touch of light yellow to create a calm yet exciting emotion. On top of the collage, I did a blind contour drawing to match the other piece, in an abstract way.

                        Counting from the left, the first part is the most blurry and shows the least amount of details. This represent the most organic part inside my head, the true nature of myself.

                        The second part feels rough but you can identify a person's face from it. This is the middle ground of my identity.

                        The third part is the most clear and is a full representation of myself. Putting three of the parts together shows the audience what really represents me and what I am made up of.

                        I took the inspiration of this artwork from the famous painting Mona Lisa and the photograph of Einstein sticking his tongue out. Appropriating elements of the two artworks with the concept of optical illusions and impossible objects as well as my portrait, I was able to create a humorous yet inspiring artwork. The darker shades of colours I used creates a mysterious and energized feeling.

                        In this artwork, I used a mix of different medias such as sharpies and coloured paper. I printed my portrait on a piece of transparent paper so that the colours can pass through. The drawing is done on a card and prints are stick onto it with glue.
